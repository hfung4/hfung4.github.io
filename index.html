  <p>Hello! My name is Henry Fung.</p>
  <p>I have been a Data Scientist from May 2019 to September 2019 at Logapps LLC, a public management consultancy in Virginia. There, I work on classifying software requirements from SRS documents using various ML models (CNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes) with word embeddings.  Currently, I am a Research Data Analyst at Johns Hopkins Univeristy, where I work on data projects that focus on using large public employee data to gain insights into the relationship between management practices, job characteristics and employee motivation. </p>
  <p>Prior to transitioning to data science, I had a career in aerospace engineering.  I worked in the flight simulation industry between 2011 to 2016 as an avionics systems engineer.  I developed and test software that simulate Boeing/Airbus autopilot systems at the flight simulator manufacturers <a href="https://www.cae.com/">CAE Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.trusimulation.com/">Textron Inc.</a> in Montreal, Canada.   
  
   <p>If you are interested in learning more about my professional experience, I have included my <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> here.</p>
