  <p>Hello! My name is Henry Fung.</p>
  <p>I am currently a final year graduate student in International Economics at Johns Hopkins University.  During the summer of 2019, I was a data analytics specialist at Logapps LLC, a public management consultancy in Virginia. There, I worked on a nlp project to analyze software requirements from SRS documents. In recent years, I spent my time working on data projects that are at the intersection of machine learning and management problems of large public/private organizations. </p>
  <p>Prior to transitioning to data science, I had a career in aerospace engineering.  I worked in the flight simulation industry between 2011 to 2016 as an avionics systems engineer.  I developed and test software that simulate Boeing/Airbus autopilot systems at the flight simulator manufacturers <a href="https://www.cae.com/">CAE Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.trusimulation.com/">Textron Inc.</a> in Montreal, Canada.   
  
   <p>If you are interested in learning more about my professional experience, I have included my resume <a href="resume.pdf">resume</a> here.</p>
