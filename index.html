  <p>Hello! My name is Henry Fung.</p>
  <p>I am currently a Data Scientist at <a href=" http://surgoventures.org/ "> Surgo Ventures, Inc. </a> in Washington DC, where I support Surgo's research activities and focus on applying machine learning approaches to problems in global development and public health. </p>
  <p> Prior to Surgo, I worked on data projects in the private and public sector. My work ranges from using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze software requirement texts for a project planning tool to inferring the relationship between management practices and employee attitudes in large public organizations. </p>
  <p> I hold a MA. in International Economics from Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies, and a BA. in Economics and Mathematics from McGill University. 
  <p>Prior to transitioning to data science, I had a previous career as an Avionics Systems Engineer.  I developed and test simulation software for Boeing/Airbus autopilot systems at the flight simulator manufacturers <a href="https://www.cae.com/">CAE Inc.</a> and <a href="https://www.trusimulation.com/">Textron Inc.</a> in Montreal, Canada.  I hold a MASc. in Mechanical Engineering, and a B.Eng in Aerospace Engineering, both from Carleton University.   
  
   <p>If you are interested in learning more about my professional experience, I have included my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/henry-fung-13a45432/">LinkedIn profile</a> here.</p>
